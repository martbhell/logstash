logstash-patterns
========

Some grok patterns that could be helpful to parse some logs.

  * apachessl - because the patterns that come with apache don't work if SSL is on
  * auditd - logs from auditd
  * hpswitches - HP procurve switches
  * oom - kernel out of memory killer messages
  * ossec - logs from ossec
  * slurm - parsing some logs from slurm (needs much work)
